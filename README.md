# Cenix

### Cenix is just another open-source anticheat, but I promise this one won't die in 2 weeks like the others.

**If you would like to contribute, go ahead.**

A list of things to be done:
    ** Top Priority **
  - [ ] Fix anticheat causing false flags when a user has a higher speed level than what possible in survival
  - [ ] **(Assigned to Jinky)** Fix false flags on speed when a user goes up staircases
   ** Normal/Lower Priority **
  - [ ] Save reports in a much better way. (Probably h2, maybe add mysql save option ?)
  - [ ] Add command for viewing a user's reports, & viewing latest reports ( ^ finish above first ^ )


A list of what is currently detected (mostly):
 - Fast Place
 - Fast Break
 - Nuker (Out of Line of Sight)
 - Flight (Hover/Rise/Float)
 - Speed
 - Kill Aura
 - Multi Aura
 - Jesus (Water Walk)
 - Boat Fly
